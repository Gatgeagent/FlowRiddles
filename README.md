Repository for learning Kotlin Flow API, inspired by [RxRiddles](https://github.com/vanniktech/RxRiddles)

Each riddle is a class with an unit test that will verify your solution.
There are multiple ways to create function that will make test pass, nevertheless riddles are constructed to be solved with single operator or extension.
